# image-search

Data can exist not only in textual format but also as images, audio, video etc. Of these all, we come across images most frequently.
There are very efficient tools to index and rapidly retrieve text data but still there arenâ€™t fast and efficient tools to Index and
retrieve images. The only way to search for an image on a machine is through the name of corresponding image file.In order to avoid
this, there should be means to do this on the basis of content of the image rather. Here we try to Index and retrieve image on the
basis of the colors in image using a novel approach of human perception of colors.Develop a tool for image indexing and retrieval
based on human perceptual clustering of color images. This color clustering produces for each image a small set of representative
colors which captures the color proper-Ties of the image.
